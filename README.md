CSE401 : Computer Architecture. I took it with Dr.Gomez in winter 2020 at csusb.

His website for this class is http://www.cse.csusb.edu/egomez/cs401.html.

His personal website is http://www.cse.csusb.edu/egomez/ .

note : A program written in Verilog that simulates the MIPS architecture. The original source code was incomplete and was modified extensively to work. The missing modules and written code was completed using the design/diagrams outlined in the lab manual.
